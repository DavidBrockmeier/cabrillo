			<p>Cabrillo Park Rules and Regulations do not permit short term rentals of 30 days or less. Companies like AirBnb, VRBO, or similar, who offer short term rentals, should never be used.</p>
			<p><br>Also, all dogs are required to have their DNA registered with the Front Office within 72 hours of moving onto the property. If you have not registered your dog yet then please do so as soon as possible.</p>

          <div class="contentText">
             <p>We want to remind you that it is your responsibility to keep your vehicle(s) secure. In addition to keeping your vehicle locked and not having any valuables visible, you should also think about purchasing a car alarm, lock lugs for your tires, and/or a steering wheel lock. All of these will discourage a potential criminal. We are aware of the isolated problems and are adjusting our walking guard accordingly. "If you see something, say something!"</p>

          <div class="contentText">
             <p>Please watch your children while they swim: it only takes a few seconds for a child to drown. When using the pool please be courteous to your neighbors by using headphones for your music and limiting guests to two people per household. What continues to make Cabrillo Park a great place to live is everyone's kindness and consideration of others.  Thank you for caring! Also, for security purposes please make sure you close the gate behind you. Remember: <b>When you see something...say something</b></p>
